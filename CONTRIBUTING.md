# Contributing to `pocket-stats`
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
Report a bug by [opening a new issue]().

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
A [good example](http://www.openradar.me/11905408)  from Craig Hockenberry.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce:
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can, so we can reproduce what you was seeing.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

## Coding Style
* **4 spaces** for indentation rather than tabs.
* You can try running `python -m flake8` to check your style.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your any contributions you make will be licensed under the [MIT Software License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
